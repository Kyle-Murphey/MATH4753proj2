abstract: This project is all about applications of SLR to real data using R. I am using a set of data containing the quality of red wine based on various physiochemical properties. The data for this project was found in a UCI archive for machine learning. I will be using this dataset and my leanrings from this semester to analyze the data. The goal is to use Simple Linear Regression on the data to find the correlation between the properties and the overall taste quality of the red wine. I aim to find whether or not there is a correlation to these properties and how we as humans rate their qualities.

# Introduction

Wine is one of humanities oldest alcoholic beverages. It has been used recreationally, religiously, and medicinally throughout the millennia. Wine was seen as a creation by the Greek god Dionysos (or Bacchus, if you were Roman) to the people. It was said that the god gifted the vine to a man named Ikarios. Ikarios used this gift to make wine, which he was inclined to share with his fellow people. When he shared the wine, the others got freaked out by the effects, thinking that they had been poisoned. They ended up murdering Ikarios, and his creation spread from there. Image and information found: [see @wine]

Although there are still religious rituals that use wine, such as the Christian ritual known as "communion" or the "Eucharist", it is used far more frequently for recreational purposes. Wine makes up roughly 11.4% of all alcohol sold in America, which comes out to ~ 3.8 billion liters of the fruity beverage. Image and information found: [see @abm]

</center>

With that much wine being sold in just America alone, companies have plenty of motivation to produce quality wines for people to enjoy. When it comes to the quality of a wine, much is subjective. How do you quantify quality of taste? The wine must be tasted by humans in order to determine the quality. With such subjective testing, its difficult to find what properties of the wine that people like. In order to try to find a trend in quality, various physiochemical properties have been recorded along with their coinsiding quality rating in this dataset.


## My Interest

I am a college student. Alcohol is well ingrained into the college culture. As a man who is part of said culture, I have had my fair share of alcoholic beverages. The more that my pallete has adjusted, the more I have become appreciative of wine. As a huge fan of juice growing up, it just makes sense that I make the gradual transition over to wine. It has quickly become one of my go-to drinks when it is available. With my growing interest in this drink, I have often wondered why some wines make me fall in love, whereas other wines make me fall over. This analysis is an attempt to seek out and identify the factors that contribute to this overall quality.


## Data

This data is pulled from a 2009 study in which researchers at the University of Minho in Portugal attempted to predict taste preferences using physiochemical properties of red wine. The dataset contains 1599 samples with 11 different chemical properties and the qualities for each sample. The properties measured are the fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. The quality is based on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best).
```{r}
wine=read.csv("winequality-red.csv")
head(wine)
```

## The Problem to Solve

I will analyze the data in an attempt to find a correlation between the amount compounds in a wine and its overall quality. I do not expect all compounds to make a statistical difference in quality, but I am hoping to find at least a few. The results of this analysis will help me and anyone else who reads this make better guesses as to the quality of wine based on the compounds it contains.

## Preliminary Plots and Interpretation of the Data

There are a lot of factors that could play a roll in the quality of the wine. I will show graphs of the wine quality given each compound below. Each compound come with 3 graphs: a scatterplot, a residual vs fitted, and a histogram. The scatter plots and histograms are to show the distribution of the data and the frequency. The residual vs fitted will be discussed later on in the document.

# Theory behind the Analysis

As you can see in the preliminary graphs, the data appears scattered randomly, and that there isn't much of a linear trend to analyze. I believe that the quality would drop given that too much of any one compound is in the wine. That being said, I will still attempt to find some linear correlation within the data, even if the relationship is minimal. The histograms show that the independent variables have an uneven distribution of the frequency of values tested. This can cause unexpected and faux trends in the data. Even though this may skew some results, I will conveniently ignore those facts in order to produce some sort of regressional analysis. I will be make a probabilistic model of a simple linear regression. The model assumes that the line produce by $\bar{y}$ given any value of $x$. Any deviating points are are represented by $\epsilon$. The equation of the line is: $$y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+\epsilon_i$$ The variables $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\epsilon_i$ are as follows: $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are random variables, and $\epsilon_i$ is the random error. If you drop $\epsilon_i$, you get the equation for $\bar{y}$ given any value of $x$. This can be represented as such: $$E(y)=E(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+\epsilon_i)$$ $$=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+E(\epsilon_i)$$ $$=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i$$ Given this information, we can represent this as $E(Y|x)$ where $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept and $\beta_1$ is the slope. According to Mendenhall and Sinich 2016 [see @mendenhall], we need to make the following assumptions about $\epsilon$ in order to estimate the $\beta$ parameters. These assumptions are: 

* The mean of the probability distribution of $\epsilon$ is 0. 
* The variance of the probability distribution of $\epsilon$ is constant for all settings of the independent variable x.
* The probability distribution of $\epsilon$ is normal.
* The error associated with one value of y has no effect on the errors associated with other y values.

Given these assumptions, we should be able to produce some estimates for the $\beta$ parameters.


# Estimating the Parameters

Since the data isn't very linear and there are a lot of independent variables, I will be selecting 2 independent variables that show the best fit based on their multiple $R^2$ value. The 2 variables with the highest multiple $R^2$ values are alcohol and volatile acidity.

```{r}
summary(wine.alc)
summary(wine.va)
```
With multiple $R^2$ values of 0.2267 and 0.1525, respectively. While very low, they are the best I have to work with.
Based on these summaries, we can say that $$\hat{\beta_{0a}}=1.87497$$ $$\hat{\beta_{1a}}=0.36084$$ and $$\hat{\beta_{0v}}=6.56575$$ $$\hat{\beta_{1v}}=-1.76144$$

## Confidence Interval
```{r}
ciReg(wine.alc,conf.level=0.95,print.out=TRUE)
ciReg(wine.va,conf.level=0.95,print.out=TRUE)
```

## The Least-Squares Estimates

$$\hat{\beta_{0a}}+\hat{\beta_{1a}}x_i=1.87497+0.36084x_i$$ $$\hat{\beta_{0v}}+\hat{\beta_{1v}}x_i=6.56575-1.76144x_i$$ The slope $\hat{\beta_{1a}}=0.36084$ tells us that the quality rises 0.36084 for every 1 increase in alcohol. The slope $\hat{\beta_{1v}}=-1.76144$ tells us that the quality lowers 1.76144 for every 1 increase in volatile acidity.

# Verifying Assumptions

I will attempt to verify the above assumptions to show whether or not a straight line is the best fit for the model.
```{r}
plot(wine$quality~wine$alcohol,bg="Purple",pch=21,cex=1.2,data=wine)
abline(wine.alc)
```
```{r}
plot(wine$quality~wine$volatile.acidity,bg="Blue",pch=21,cex=1.2,data=wine)
abline(wine.va)
```

These plots do not indicate that a linear model is the best fit for the data.

## Plot Residuals

The residuals tell us by how much points deviate from the fitted line. They help us to see just how far the points are varying from the line.
```{r}
plot(wine$quality~wine$alcohol,bg="Green",pch=21,cex=1.2,data=wine)
abline(wine.alc)
yhata=with(wine,predict(wine.alc,data.frame(alcohol)))
with(wine,{segments(alcohol,quality,alcohol,yhata)})
abline(wine.alc)
```
```{r}
plot(wine$quality~wine$volatile.acidity,bg="Maroon",pch=21,cex=1.2,data=wine)
abline(wine.va)
yhatv=with(wine,predict(wine.va,data.frame(volatile.acidity)))
with(wine,{segments(volatile.acidity,quality,volatile.acidity,yhatv)})
abline(wine.va)
```

As you can see, there is *quite* a lot of deviation from the line.

## Plot of Means

We can see the difference between the means of alcohol and quality, and volatile acidity and quality by graphing quality vs alcohol and quality vs volatile acidity. I will also show then deviations from the fitted line. This also gives us the RSS.
```{r}
plot(wine$quality~wine$alcohol,bg="Blue",pch=21,cex=1.2,data=wine)
abline(wine.alc)
with(wine,abline(h=mean(quality)))
abline(wine.alc)
with(wine,{segments(alcohol,mean(quality),alcohol,yhata,col="Red")})
```
```{r}
plot(wine$quality~wine$volatile.acidity,bg="Cyan",pch=21,cex=1.2,data=wine)
abline(wine.va)
with(wine,abline(h=mean(quality)))
abline(wine.va)
with(wine,{segments(volatile.acidity,mean(quality),volatile.acidity,yhatv,col="maroon")})
```

## Plot of Means with Total Deviation Line Segments

If we plot the means of quality vs alcohol and quality vs volatile acidity and add the total deviation lines, we can visually see $\hat{y}=\bar{y}$. This also gives us the MSS.
```{r}
plot(wine$quality~wine$alcohol,bg="Blue",pch=21,cex=1.2,data=wine)
with(wine,abline(h=mean(quality)))
with(wine,{segments(alcohol,quality,alcohol,mean(quality),col="Red")})
```
```{r}
plot(wine$quality~wine$volatile.acidity,bg="Green",pch=21,cex=1.2,data=wine)
with(wine,abline(h=mean(quality)))
with(wine,{segments(volatile.acidity,quality,volatile.acidity,mean(quality),col="Maroon")})
```

## Using RSS, MSS, and TSS

```{r}
RSSa=with(wine,sum((quality-yhata)^2))
RSSa

MSSa=with(wine,sum((yhata-mean(quality))^2))
MSSa

TSSa=with(wine,sum((quality-mean(quality))^2))
TSSa


RSSv=with(wine,sum((quality-yhatv)^2))
RSSv

MSSv=with(wine,sum((yhatv-mean(quality))^2))
MSSv

TSSv=with(wine,sum((quality-mean(quality))^2))
TSSv
```
Since $R^2$ = $\frac{MSS}{TSS}$, which will be the value for the trend line. The higher the percentage, the better the fit for the data.
```{r}
MSSa/TSSa
MSSv/TSSv
```
We get a 22.67% fit for alcohol and a 12.25% for volatile acidity. These percentages are very low, and indicate that a linear model is not the best fit. 


## Specifying the Probability Distribution

```{r}
trendscatter(quality~alcohol,f=0.5,data=wine,main="Quality vs Alcohol")
```

Based on this trend, the quality rises as the alcohol levels do.
```{r}
trendscatter(quality~volatile.acidity,f=0.5,data=wine,main="Quality vs Volatile Acidity")
```

Based on this trend, the quality lowers as the volatile acidity levels increase

Residuals:
```{r}
wine.resa=residuals(wine.alc)
wine.resv=residuals(wine.va)
```
Fitted:
```{r}
wine.fita=fitted(wine.alc)
wine.fitv=fitted(wine.va)
```

## Plot the Residuals vs Alcohol

```{r}
plot(wine$alcohol,wine.resa,ylab="Residuals")
```

The residuals are not symmetrically distributed about 0 on the y-axis, this tells us that there is a lot of deviation from the best fit line.

## Plot the Residuals vs Volatile Acidity

```{r}
plot(wine$volatile.acidity,wine.resv,ylab="Residuals")
```

The residuals are not symmetrically distributed about 0 on the y-axis, this tells us that there is a lot of deviation from the best fit line.

## Plot the Residuals vs Alcohol Fitted values

```{r}
trendscatter(wine.resa~wine.fita,f=0.5,data=wine.alc,xlab="Fitted",ylab="Residuals",main="Residuals vs Alcohol Fitted Values")
```

The line is not very straight about 0 on the y-axis, so the plot is "unsatisfactory".

## Plot the Residuals vs Volatile Acidity Fitted values

```{r}
trendscatter(wine.resv~wine.fitv,f=0.5,data=wine.alc,xlab="Fitted",ylab="Residuals",main="Residuals vs Volatile Acidity Fitted Values")
```

The line is not very straight about 0 on the y-axis, so the plot is "unsatisfactory".

## Check Normality

### Alcohol
```{r}
normcheck(wine.alc,shapiro.wilk=TRUE)
```

We obtain a p-value of 0, so we reject the Null hypothesis that the errors are distributed normally. The results of the Shapiro-Wilk test tell us that we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (p-value of 0). This tells us that the data is not distributed normally.


### Volatile Acidity
```{r}
normcheck(wine.va,shapiro.wilk=TRUE)
```

We obtain a p-value of 0, so we reject the Null hypothesis that the errors are distributed normally. The results of the Shapiro-Wilk test tell us that we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (p-value of 0). This tells us that the data is not distributed normally.

## Testing Another Model

As we can see, a linear model is not the best model for the data. Here, we will test a quadratic model for the dataset.

```{r}
quada.lm=lm(quality~alcohol+I(alcohol^2),data=wine)
plot(quality~alcohol,data=wine)
myplot=function(x){quada.lm$coef[1]+quada.lm$coef[2]*x+quada.lm$coef[3]*x^2}
curve(myplot,lwd=2,add=TRUE)
summary(quada.lm)
```

```{r}
quadv.lm=lm(quality~volatile.acidity+I(volatile.acidity^2),data=wine)
plot(quality~volatile.acidity,data=wine)
myplot=function(x){quadv.lm$coef[1]+quadv.lm$coef[2]*x+quadv.lm$coef[3]*x^2}
curve(myplot,lwd=2,add=TRUE)
summary(quadv.lm)
```

The line is very similar to the linear trend line, so this model probably isn't the best either. However, the multiple $R^2$ value slightly increased for each, so it is a better fit than the linear model.

### Residuals vs Fitted

```{r}
qwine.resa=residuals(quada.lm)
fwine.fita=fitted(quada.lm)
trendscatter(qwine.resa~fwine.fita,f=0.5,data=wine.alc,xlab="Fitted",ylab="Residuals",main="Residuals vs Alcohol Fitted Values")
```
```{r}
qwine.resv=residuals(quadv.lm)
fwine.fitv=fitted(quadv.lm)
trendscatter(qwine.resv~fwine.fitv,f=0.5,data=wine.alc,xlab="Fitted",ylab="Residuals",main="Residuals vs Volatile Acidity Fitted Values")
```

Each trend line is not straight about 0 on the y-axis, so the plots are "unsatisfactory".

### Normality
```{r}
normcheck(quada.lm,shapiro.wilk=TRUE)
normcheck(quadv.lm,shapiro.wilk=TRUE)
```

We obtain a p-value of 0 for both, so we reject the Null hypothesis that the errors are distributed normally. The results of the Shapiro-Wilk test tell us that we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (p-value of 0). This tells us that the data is not distributed normally.

### Comparing Models

While neither model is very good for the data, we have evidence that the quadratic model is a better fit than the linear. For the linear model, we obtained 0.2267 and 0.1525 for the multiple $R^2$ values for alcohol and volatile acidity, respectively. In the quadratic model, we obtained 0.228 and 0.1544 for the multiple $R^2$ values for alcohol and volatile acidity, respectively. Although only slightly higher, this still indicates that a quadratic model will fit better than a linear model.


# ANOVA as Confirmation

```{r}
wine.aova=aov(quality~alcohol,data=wine)
wine.aovv=aov(quality~volatile.acidity,data=wine)
summary(wine.aova)
summary(wine.aovv)
```
The pvalues for these anova sets and significantly below 0.05, so this test rejects the Null hypothesis. We can say that the ANOVA confirms that this model is not grea for the given data. There is nearly no chance that an F ratio greater than the Null value will be true.



# Avoiding Bias with Cook's Distance

Biases can skew the data you are trying to analyze. Biases are often caused by outliers. Outliers can influence trends and skew the overall quality of the data. Cook's distance calculates the effects of removing said outliers. It estimates the influence that the data point has on the output. If the point is far enough away from other values, we need to take a deeper look at the data without these points. [see @wiki]

## Alcohol
```{r}
cooks20x(wine.alc)
```

653 is far and beyond the rest of the values. This data point has the potential the skew the data, so I will make a new model excluding it.

```{r}
wine2.alc=lm(quality~alcohol,data=wine[-653,])
summary(wine2.alc)
```
The multiple $R^2$ for the model increased to 0.2314, but it did not increase enough say that this point had enough sway to throw the whole model off.

## Volatile Acidity
```{r}
cooks20x(wine.va)
```

391 is the farthest value for the volatile acidity, so that is the value I will take out and re-examine.

```{r}
wine2.va=lm(quality~volatile.acidity,data=wine[-391,])
summary(wine2.va)
```
The multiple $R^2$ for the model increased to 0.1563, but it did not increase enough say that this point had enough sway to throw the whole model off.


# Conclusion

In conclusion, there is no linear correlation between the physiochemical properties and the quality of the wine. The dataset has high variations from the fitted line and is at best is around a 23% match to the model (for quality~alcohol). While there might be "peak" points in this data, it does not help us when trying to find a linear trend. As with most things, such as cooking, we can expect that adding too much of one thing will decrease the quality. Knowing this, we could probably improve the data to fit the model by "stress-testing" each compound to find the point at which the quality begins to decrease indefinitely. This, along with recording each independent variable an even amount of times (i.e., if 10 tests were run on samples with an alcohol level of 9.4, then 10 tests should be run on samples with alcohol levels of 9.5, and so on), and measurements taken at more evenly spaced intervals, would make the data set fit the linear model better, given there is a statistical relationship at all. The quadratic model ending up fitting the data better than the linear model, but just barely. I was unable to come up with any significant relationship between the properties of the wine and the overall quality. That being said, it does not mean that a correlation does not exist. It just means that I was unable to find a linear correlation given my skills in the subject area.
